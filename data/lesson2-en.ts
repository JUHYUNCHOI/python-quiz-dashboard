          content: `Data in the real world comes in different forms too.

- **Numbers**: 100, 3.14, -5 → you can calculate with them
- **Text**: "hello", "python" → you can print or join them
- **Yes/No**: True, False → you can use them to decide things

> 💡 **Why split data into types?**
> Even the same \`5\` behaves differently as a **number 5** vs. text **"5"**.
> - \`5 + 3\` → 8 (addition)
> - \`"5" + "3"\` → "53" (joining text!)
>
> Python looks at the **type** of a value to decide "how should I handle this?"

### Everyday analogies

- **int (integer)** — apples in a basket, students in class — **things you can count**
- **float (real number)** — height 1.75m, temperature 36.5°C — **things you measure**
- **str (string)** — names, messages — **information made of letters**
- **bool (boolean)** — light on/off, pass/fail — **one of two choices**

Let's look at each one!`

          content: `### 1️⃣ Integer (int) — whole numbers, no decimal

\`\`\`python
10, -5, 0, 1000
\`\`\`

**Often used for:** age, score, number of people, item counts — **anything you can count**

---

### 2️⃣ Float — numbers with a decimal point

\`\`\`python
3.14, -0.5, 2.0
\`\`\`

> 💡 \`2.0\` is also a float! Just adding **.0** turns it into a float.

**Often used for:** height, weight, prices that aren't whole units, average scores, probability

---

### 3️⃣ String (str) — letters

\`\`\`python
"hello", 'python', "123"
\`\`\`

⚠️ **If it has quotes, it's a string — always!** \`123\` is a number, but \`"123"\` is the text "123".
- \`"double quotes"\` ✅
- \`'single quotes'\` ✅ — both fine, just match the pair

**Often used for:** names, messages, addresses, phone numbers, passwords — **anything made of letters**

---

### 4️⃣ Boolean (bool) — True or False

\`\`\`python
True, False
\`\`\`

⚠️ **Must start with a capital letter!** \`true\` ❌, \`True\` ✅

**Often used for:** logged in or not, pass/fail, comparison results — anything that's **one of exactly two options**`

print(type(3.14))     # <class 'float'>
print(type('hello'))  # <class 'str'>
print(type(True))     # <class 'bool'>
\`\`\`

### How to read the output

\`<class 'int'>\` looks long, but the only part that matters is the **word inside the quotes**.

- \`<class 'int'>\` → it's an int!
- \`<class 'str'>\` → it's a str!
- \`<class 'float'>\` → it's a float!
- \`<class 'bool'>\` → it's a bool!

> 💡 The word \`class\` shows up later (lesson 41). For now just treat it as "the label that tells me the type."

### When you'll actually use this

- A friend's code has a value and you can't tell its type
- Checking whether some input is a number or text
- Debugging an error — "wait, maybe the type is wrong?"`

print(False)  # False

### Everyday analogies

- Is the light on? → True / False
- Did you pass the test? → True / False
- Are you logged in? → True / False

**Anything with exactly one of two answers** belongs to bool.

### ⚠️ Must start with a capital letter!

- ✅ \`True\`, \`False\`
- ❌ \`true\`, \`false\` → NameError!
- ❌ \`TRUE\`, \`FALSE\` → NameError!

### Compare two values and a bool pops out

\`\`\`python
print(10 > 5)    # True   (10 is greater than 5)
\`\`\`

> 💡 Besides \`>\`, there are more comparisons: \`<\`, \`==\`, \`!=\`. You'll see them in detail in **lesson 4 (operators)**. For now, just remember "comparison result = bool".

### ❌ Things that don't work

\`\`\`python
print(true)         # NameError — lowercase is not allowed
print("True")       # prints True, but this is a str, not a bool!
\`\`\`

> ⚠️ Once you wrap it in quotes like \`"True"\`, it's a **string**. The real bool is just \`True\` with no quotes!`

Wrap it in quotes to store it as a string:

### 💡 Nice to know (optional)

A little outside today's main topic, but worth keeping in mind:

**The float gotcha** — computers can't store decimals with perfect accuracy.
\`\`\`python
print(0.1 + 0.2)   # 0.30000000000000004 😱
\`\`\`
Not getting exactly 0.3 is normal! For exact math you'd handle it specially, but for now just "this can happen."

**True / False actually behave like numbers** — \`True\` is 1, \`False\` is 0.
\`\`\`python
print(True + True)   # 2
\`\`\`
A curious fact. You'll see it again in the conditionals lesson.`
