In C++, a **reference** is an **alias** (another name) for an existing variable!

\`\`\`cpp
int x = 10;
int& ref = x;   // ref is a reference to x
\`\`\`

\`ref\` and \`x\` point to the exact same memory. Change \`ref\`, and \`x\` changes too!

\`\`\`cpp
int x = 10;
int& ref = x;
ref = 20;        // change ref...
cout << x;       // x is also 20! They share the same memory
\`\`\`

💡 \`&\` declares a reference — ref and x point to the same memory location!

💡 The & symbol has multiple meanings! Here it means **reference declaration**. Later it's also used as the **address-of operator**, but you can tell them apart from context.`

// ref = 20;    // ❌ Error! const means no modification!
\`\`\`

When you pass large data (like a 1000-character string) to a function, copying it is slow. Using \`const string&\` lets you read the original directly while locking it from modification. Safe and fast!

Why use const references? Two great reasons:

**1. No copy — it's fast! (Performance)**
\`\`\`cpp
string longText = "A very long string...";

string copy = longText;        // Full copy! Slow
const string& ref = longText;  // Just a reference! Fast
\`\`\`

**2. Prevents accidental changes! (Safety)**
\`\`\`cpp
const string& ref = longText;
// ref = "change it";  // ❌ Compile error! Safe!
\`\`\`

| Type | Read | Modify | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| \`int& ref\` | ✅ | ✅ | When you need to modify |
| \`const int& ref\` | ✅ | ❌ | Fast read-only access |

💡 const references are **extremely common** in function parameters! We'll see lots of this in the next chapter.`

          title: "📞 Passing Values to Functions (Call by Value)",
          content: `In C++, when you pass a variable to a function, the value is **copied** by default! This is called **Call by Value**.

\`\`\`cpp
void tryChange(int x) {
    x = 99;   // Only changes the copy!
}

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    tryChange(num);
    cout << num;   // Still 10! 😱
}
\`\`\`

When you pass \`num\` to \`tryChange\`, a **copy** is made. Changing \`x\` inside the function doesn't touch the original \`num\`!

Let's compare with Python:

**Python 🐍:**
\`\`\`python
def try_change(x):
    x = 99      # integers are immutable!

num = 10
try_change(num)
print(num)      # 10 — unchanged in Python too!
\`\`\`

In Python, integers don't change either because they're immutable. But in C++, **every type** is copied by default!

| Scenario | C++ (default) | Python |
|---|---|---|
| Pass int | Copied (unchanged) | Immutable (unchanged) |
| Pass string | Copied (unchanged) | Object reference |
| Pass list/vector | Copied! (unchanged) | Object reference (changes!) |

💡 C++ copies by default! This is a major difference from Python.`

\`\`\`cpp
void change(int& x) {   // Added &!
    x = 99;   // Changes the original!
}

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    change(num);
    cout << num;   // 99! ✅
}
\`\`\`

With \`int& x\`, the parameter \`x\` becomes an **alias** for \`num\`. Changing \`x\` changes \`num\` directly!

A classic use case: the **swap function!**
\`\`\`cpp
void swap(int& a, int& b) {
    int temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}

int main() {
    int x = 1, y = 2;
    swap(x, y);
    cout << x << " " << y;  // 2 1
}
\`\`\`

In Python, \`x, y = y, x\` does it in one line. In C++, you build a swap function using references!

| Method | Syntax | Modifies original? |
|---|---|---|
| Call by Value | \`void f(int x)\` | ❌ |
| Call by Reference | \`void f(int& x)\` | ✅ |

💡 Just one \`&\` completely changes how the function behaves!

References (&) and pointers (*) serve a similar purpose but are different tools. A reference is an 'alias,' while a pointer is 'a variable that stores an address.' We'll learn about pointers in the next lesson!`

- ✅ **const Reference** — \`const int& ref = x;\` is read-only, no copy needed!
- ✅ **Call by Value** — \`void f(int x)\` passes a copy, original unchanged
- ✅ **Call by Reference** — \`void f(int& x)\` passes an alias, original can be modified
- ✅ **swap function** — A classic example of using references!

| Parameter Style | Syntax | Modifies original? | Copy cost? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Call by Value | \`void f(int x)\` | ❌ | Yes |
| Call by Reference | \`void f(int& x)\` | ✅ | None |
| const Reference | \`void f(const int& x)\` | ❌ | None |

💡 **Rule of thumb:** Need to modify? Use \`&\`. Read-only? Use \`const &\`. Small values? Just copy!
