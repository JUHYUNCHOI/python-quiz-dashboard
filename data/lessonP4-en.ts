- \`turtle\` library (graphics)
- \`class\` – Head, Tail, Tails, Food
- \`import\` – splitting code into files

- 🖥️ Create a window (screen)
- 🐢 Create a turtle (shape) and move it around
- ⌨️ Receive keyboard input

          content: `## Try typing this in VS Code!

📁 Create a new folder \`snake_game\`, then create \`main.py\` inside it.

\`\`\`python
import turtle

# Width and height of the screen
w = 600
h = 600

# Half the width and height of the screen
halfW = w / 2
halfH = h / 2

# Screen
screen = turtle.Screen()
screen.title('Snake Game')
screen.setup(width=w, height=h)
screen.bgcolor('#cfe0e8')
screen.tracer(0)
\`\`\`

**Run it!** (Ctrl+F5 or Run)
If you see a light blue screen, you did it! ✅

### Line by Line Breakdown!

- \`w = 600\`, \`h = 600\` → Store screen size in variables! Change it here and the whole thing changes
- \`halfW = w / 2\` → **300**. We'll use this for wall collision detection (half the screen size)
- \`turtle.Screen()\` → Creates the game window (screen)
- \`.title('Snake Game')\` → Sets the window title
- \`.setup(width=w, height=h)\` → 600 wide, 600 tall in pixels
- \`.bgcolor('#cfe0e8')\` → Background color! \`#cfe0e8\` is light blue (HTML color code)
- \`.tracer(0)\` → Turns off automatic screen drawing, so we manually refresh with \`screen.update()\`!

### 🖥️ Run it up to here!
Add \`screen.mainloop()\` at the very bottom of your code and run (Ctrl+F5):
If you see a light blue 600×600 window, it works! ✅ (Nothing shows on screen yet — that's expected!)`

![turtle Coordinate System](/lessons/p4/coordinate.svg)

Normally, the top-left corner is (0,0),
but in **turtle, the center of the screen is (0, 0)**!

For a 600×600 screen:
- **Right** edge: x = **300** (halfW)
- **Left** edge: x = **-300** (-halfW)
- **Top** edge: y = **300** (halfH)
- **Bottom** edge: y = **-300** (-halfH)

We'll use them to check if the snake went outside the walls.`

        self.a.goto(0, 100)
        self.a.direction = 'stop'
\`\`\`

### Line by Line Breakdown!

- \`class Head:\` → Creates a class (blueprint) called **Head**!
- \`def __init__(self):\` → A function that **runs automatically** when you call \`Head()\`
- \`self\` → Refers to "myself". It's the first parameter in every function inside a class!
- \`self.a = turtle.Turtle()\` → Creates a turtle and stores it in \`self.a\`
- \`.shape('circle')\` → Circle shape
- \`.color('#587e76')\` → A greenish color (HTML color code)
- \`.penup()\` → Don't draw lines when moving (lift the pen up)
- \`.goto(0, 100)\` → Starting position at (0, 100) (slightly above center)
- \`self.a.direction = 'stop'\` → **Adding a new attribute!** Starts off stopped

💡 \`direction\` is not an attribute that originally exists on turtle.
We **created it ourselves** with \`self.a.direction = 'stop'\`!
Python lets you freely add attributes to objects like this.

### 🖥️ Run it up to here!
In main.py, add \`import snake\`, then \`head = snake.Head()\` + \`screen.update()\`:
You'll see a **green circle** slightly above center — that's the snake head! 🟢`

            y = self.a.ycor()

\`\`\`

### Line by Line Breakdown!

- \`def move(self):\` → The movement function called every frame!
- \`if self.a.direction == 'right':\` → If the current direction is 'right'...
- \`x = self.a.xcor()\` → Get the current x coordinate
- \`self.a.setx(x + 20)\` → Increase x by 20! (move right)
- Left is \`x - 20\`, up is \`y + 20\`, down is \`y - 20\`

💡 What if \`direction\` is \`'stop'\`? It doesn't match any \`if\`, so it doesn't move!
That's why we set \`direction = 'stop'\` at the beginning.

💡 Why use \`setx()\` and \`sety()\` instead of \`forward()\`?
We directly manipulate the x, y coordinates so it moves in a grid-like pattern!`

- \`if self.a.direction != 'down':\` → **Only if not currently going down!**
- \`self.a.direction = 'up'\` → Change direction to up

💡 **Using WASD keys!** Gamer style instead of arrow keys ⌨️
We also register uppercase (W, S, D, A) so it works even with Caps Lock on!

### 🖥️ Run it up to here!
Add the keyboard connections + a simple while loop to main.py and run:
The **green circle moves 20 pixels at a time with WASD!** ⌨️

Add this at the bottom of main.py:

while True:

    head.move()

    # Move tails
    tails.followHead(head.getX(), head.getY())

    time.sleep(0.1)
    screen.update()

screen.mainloop()
\`\`\`

### Line by Line Breakdown!

- \`while True:\` → **Infinite loop!** Keeps running until the game ends
- \`head.move()\` → Move 20 pixels based on the current direction
- \`tails.followHead(...)\` → The entire tail follows the head
- \`time.sleep(0.1)\` → **Wait 0.1 seconds**! This number determines the game speed
- \`screen.update()\` → Refresh the screen! (Since tracer(0), we must do it manually)
- \`screen.mainloop()\` → Keeps the window open (outside the while loop)

💡 Change to \`time.sleep(0.05)\` and it becomes 2x faster!
Change to \`time.sleep(0.2)\` and it slows down!

### 🖥️ Run it up to here!
The head moves with WASD, and the food (🐢 turtle shape) appears on screen!
Eating it won't do anything yet — we'll add that in the next chapter!`

**Summary of what we built:**

- 🐍 \`Head\` class – Snake head (direction change, reverse prevention!)
- 🟢 \`Tail\` class – One tail segment
- 📋 \`Tails\` class – Manages all tails (list!)
- 🐢 \`Food\` class – Random position food
- 📊 Score + High Score system
- ⌨️ WASD keyboard input
- 🧱 Wall collision handling

**Concepts learned:**
- \`class\`, \`__init__\`, \`self\`, methods
- \`import\` (module = .py file)
- Game loop, list usage, distance calculation

**Challenge yourself:** 🌟
- Reset when the snake hits its own tail
- Add a game over screen
- Make the speed gradually increase!
- Add background music (pygame.mixer)`
