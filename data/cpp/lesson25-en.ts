First, see what happens when data is **not** sorted. Imagine finding **"Kim"** in a phone book.

The simplest approach: flip through **one page at a time** from page 1.

Page 1... nope. Page 2... nope. Page 3...

A 500-page book could take **500 checks** in the worst case. Arrays are the same — **1 million elements = up to 1 million checks.**

          content: `When looking for "Kim" in a phone book, do you start at page 1?

**No.** K is around the middle of the alphabet, so naturally you **open to the middle.**

This only works for one reason — **the phone book is alphabetically sorted.**
Without sorting, you'd have no idea where to look, so you'd have to start at page 1.

**Binary search turns this intuition into an algorithm:**

Open the middle (page 250): "Park" → Kim is before! **Skip the last 250 pages.**
Open the new middle (page 125): "Lee" → Kim is before! **Cut in half again.**
Keep halving — **500 pages found in just 9 checks.**

**Sort → enables binary search → much faster!**
This is why we learn sort before binary search.

### 📊 1,000,000 items — before vs after sorting

| What you want | Unsorted | After sorting (this chapter) |
|---|---|---|
| "is x there?" | 1,000,000 compares (\`find\` — full scan) | **~20** (\`binary_search\`) |
| "how many of x?" | 1,000,000 (\`count\`) | **~40** (\`upper - lower\`) |
| "first ≥ x?" | 1,000,000 (manual loop) | **~20** (\`lower_bound\`) |
| "dedupe" | tricky to write | **one line** (\`sort + unique + erase\`) |

          content: `On the next page, \`lower_bound\` returns an **iterator** instead of a plain number. Let's get comfortable with it first.

---

### Iterator = "a spot inside the vector"

The \`v.begin()\` / \`v.end()\` you've been writing with \`sort\` — those *are* iterators.

\`\`\`
   10    20    30    40    50
    ↑                          ↑
 begin()                      end() ← one *past* the last
                                     (no value — just an "end" marker)
\`\`\`

---

### You only need two things

| Syntax | Meaning |
|---|---|
| \`*it\` | the **value** at that spot |
| \`++it\` | move to the **next** spot |

\`\`\`cpp
vector<int> v = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it) {
    cout << *it << " ";   // 10 20 30 40 50
}
\`\`\`

- \`it != v.end()\` — keep going *until* the end marker (don't read end itself)
- \`++it\` for the next slot, \`*it\` for the value

> 💡 You'd usually write \`for (int x : v)\` (range-for) — shorter and more common. The pattern above is for **understanding what iterators do under the hood**.

---

### Heard of pointers?

An iterator is basically a **cousin of a pointer**. Same syntax — \`*\` reads the value, \`++\` moves forward. The difference is iterators work the same way on vector / list / map (pointers only work on vector). **You'll see this with your own eyes on the next page.**`

          component: "iteratorVsPointer",

- **vector mode**: both move to the next slot identically — pointer or iterator, either works
- **list mode**: pointer ❌ ends up at a garbage address; only iterator ✅ follows to the real next node

Switch the toggle and press \`++\` to see the difference at a glance.`

          content: `When an iterator comes back from \`lower_bound\` (or \`find\`), you'll be doing **one of two things**:

\`\`\`
   10    20    30    40    50
    ↑                ↑
 begin()             it  (points to 40)
\`\`\`

\`\`\`cpp
cout << *it;             // 40   ← *it is the value
cout << it - v.begin();  // 3    ← convert to index
\`\`\`

---

### 🛡️ Not found → returns \`v.end()\`

\`lower_bound\` and \`find\` return \`v.end()\` when the value isn't there (= "the end marker"). Reading that slot with \`*it\` is **dangerous** — there's no value there.

\`\`\`cpp
auto it = lower_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), x);
if (it != v.end()) {        // ← always check
    cout << *it;             // safe
} else {
    cout << "not found";
}
\`\`\`

> 💡 Memorize the pattern: \`auto it = ...; if (it != v.end()) { ... }\`. That one line keeps 90% of iterator code safe.

---

### Two formulas + one pattern, that's it

| Memorize | Meaning |
|---|---|
| \`*it\` | **value** at that position |
| \`it - v.begin()\` | **index** (0-based) |
| \`it != v.end()\` | **was it found** (end means not found) |

// 4 isn't here — "where would 4 go?"
lower_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), 4) - v.begin() →  2   ← right before 5 (where 4 belongs)
upper_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), 4) - v.begin() →  2   ← same spot (when value's missing, start = end)

| | \`count()\` | \`upper - lower\` |

| Speed | **O(n)** — scans everything | **O(log n)** — binary search |
| Counting in 1M elements | 1,000,000 comparisons | ~20 comparisons |

**Trap:** "So I'll just sort once and use upper-lower!" → ❌. \`sort\` itself is O(n log n) — for a **single** count, plain \`count()\` is faster.

✅ **When upper-lower really shines:**
- Data is **already** sorted
- You need to count **many times** on the same data (sort once → each query is O(log n))

Common in competitive programming; in everyday code \`count()\` is more typical.

---

### ⚠️ Heads up — \`count\` appears in **two places**

In the next lesson (map) you'll see \`m.count(key)\`. Same name, **completely different function.**

| | \`count(v.begin, v.end, x)\` | \`m.count(key)\` |
|---|---|---|
| Whose function? | algorithm (external) | **member** of map / set |
| Used on | vector, plain ranges | map, set |
| Speed | O(n) — scans the range | **O(log n)** — walks the tree directly |
| Answer | how many equal to \`x\` | does the key exist (0/1 for map, real count for multiset) |

> 💡 Same name, **different functions.** vector's \`count()\` is slow, but map's \`m.count()\` is fast because map keeps a tree inside — no sort needed. We'll revisit this in the next lesson.`
