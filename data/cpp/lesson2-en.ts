A program **has to show its results to be useful!** If it just calculates without displaying anything... nobody would know! 😅 That's why mastering cout is so important!

Actually, cout can print not just strings but **numbers** too!

\`\`\`cpp
std::cout << 42 << std::endl;       // integer
std::cout << 3.14 << std::endl;     // decimal
std::cout << 10 + 20 << std::endl;  // expression → result!
\`\`\`

Output:
\`\`\`
42
3.14
30
\`\`\`

💡 **No quotes** = number or expression! **With quotes** = string!
→ \`"42"\` is the string "42", \`42\` is the number 42 — totally different!`

\`\`\`cpp
std::cout << "Score: " << 100 << std::endl;

\`\`\`

Chaining multiple values works too:
\`\`\`cpp
std::cout << "Age: " << 14 << " Name: " << "Emma" << std::endl;
// Output: Age: 14 Name: Emma
\`\`\`

Remember how Python did it?
| Python 🐍 | C++ ⚡ |
|---|---|
| \`print("Score:", 100)\` | \`std::cout << "Score: " << 100 << std::endl;\` |
| Auto spaces ✅ | No auto spaces ❌ |

💡 \`<<\` can chain any type together! Just remember to add spaces yourself!`

Put a \`\\\` (backslash) before certain letters to create **special characters**.

std::cout << "Line 1\\nLine 2" << std::endl;

// Line 1
// Line 2

std::cout << "Name\\tAge" << std::endl;
std::cout << "Emma\\t14" << std::endl;
// Output:
// Name    Age
// Emma   14
\`\`\`

Common escape sequences:

| Code | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| \`\\n\` | New line | Can use instead of endl |
| \`\\t\` | Tab (wide space) | Great for making tables! |
| \`\\\\\` | Backslash (\\) itself | \`"C:\\\\Users"\` → C:\\Users |
| \`\\"\` | Quote (") itself | \`"He said \\"Hi\\""\` → He said "Hi" |

💡 \`\\n\` does the same thing as endl from Lesson 1! In competitive programming, \\n is used more often.

🤔 **Why do we need escape sequences?** In Python, line breaks inside strings feel natural, but in C++ you need backslash (\\\\) to express special behavior within a single line of code. The backslash acts as a signal saying "the next character has a special meaning!"`

          content: `In Lesson 1, we kept writing \`std::cout\`, \`std::endl\`... but what IS **std::**?

**std** = **standard**

It's the **group name** for all the tools C++ provides by default!

\`std::cout\` → "**cout** from the **std** group"
\`std::endl\` → "**endl** from the **std** group"
\`std::string\` → "**string** from the **std** group"

Think of it like a **last name**! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

If there are two students named "Alex" in school, how do you tell them apart?
→ "**Class 1** Alex", "**Class 2** Alex" — you add their class!

C++ does the same thing!
→ "**std::**cout" = "cout from the **std group**"

💡 The group name prevents name conflicts — that's why we write it!

C++ libraries are made up of code from many different people, so names can overlap. If there are 3 students named 'Alex' in school? You'd say 'Class 1 Alex', 'Class 2 Alex' to tell them apart. **namespace does exactly that!** So \`std::cout\` means "cout from the class called std."`

\`\`\`
Documents/photo.jpg
Desktop/photo.jpg
\`\`\`

Same "photo.jpg" but they're **different files** because they're in different folders!

C++ works the same way:
\`\`\`
std::cout    → cout inside the std folder
std::endl    → endl inside the std folder
std::string  → string inside the std folder
\`\`\`

\`std\` is C++'s **standard library namespace**.
→ All the tools C++ provides by default live here!

💡 That's why we've been writing \`std::cout\` — adding the "last name" to be specific!`

There's a solution!

\`\`\`cpp
using namespace std;

Add this one line at the top and you can **skip all the std::**!

**Before** 😮‍💨:
\`\`\`cpp
std::cout << "Hello" << std::endl;
std::cout << "World" << std::endl;
\`\`\`

**After** 😎:
\`\`\`cpp
cout << "Hello" << endl;
cout << "World" << endl;
\`\`\`

Much cleaner, right?
