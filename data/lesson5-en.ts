String + String = **glued together!**

### Where do you use this?

- **Greetings** — \`"Hi, " + name + "!"\`
- **File path joining** — \`folder + "/" + filename\`
- **Message composition** — score + name + status
- **Decoration** — separators, boxes, tables (\`*\` repeat)

The first tool for string handling. Master this and the next chapters get easier.`

          title: "📝 Joining Strings — using +",
          content: `Use the **+** operator to glue strings together!

### Why does this work?

For numbers, \`+\` means "add". For strings, it means "**join end to end**" — same symbol, different meaning depending on the type.

\`\`\`python
name = "Tom"
greeting = "Hey, " + name + "!"
print(greeting)
\`\`\`

You can join as many as you want — Python reads them left to right:

\`\`\`python
a = "Py"
b = "th"
c = "on"
print(a + b + c)   # Python
\`\`\``

\`\`\`python
print("Hello" + "World")         # HelloWorld  ← stuck together!
print("Hello" + " " + "World")   # Hello World
\`\`\`

If you want a space, you have to add \`" "\` yourself. Python won't guess.

### ❌ What doesn't work

\`\`\`python
print("Hi" + 5)   # TypeError — can't add string and number directly
\`\`\`

We'll see how to handle this in Chapter 3!`

> 💡 \`len\` is short for **\`length\`** — easy to remember once you know!

### How does it work?

You hand the string to \`len()\` like passing it to a counter. It counts every character — letters, digits, spaces, symbols, all of them — and gives you back the number.

\`\`\`python
text = "hello"
print(len(text))

print(len("hi!"))  # the ! counts too
print(len("a b"))  # the space counts too
\`\`\`

### Why is this useful?

"Is the nickname too long?" "Is the name box empty?" — questions you can answer once you know the length.`

\`\`\`python
print(len(""))    # 0 — nothing inside, length 0

### ❌ What doesn't work

\`\`\`python
print(len(123))    # TypeError — numbers don't have a "length"
\`\`\`

\`len\` is for things you can count items in — strings now, lists/dicts/sets later. Numbers are single values, so they have no length.

          content: `We often need the **last** character. But \`text[5]\` requires knowing the length — annoying.

#      [-6][-5][-4][-3][-2][-1]   ← from the back

print(text[-1])   # n (last)
print(text[-2])   # o (second from end)

\`text[-1]\` is **always the last character** — no need to know the length! Used everywhere.

Useful for sorting names later!

### ⚠️ Uppercase vs lowercase — surprise

\`\`\`python
print("apple" < "Apple")    # False — uppercase is "smaller"!
\`\`\`

The computer gives every character a hidden number, and **uppercase letters get smaller numbers** than lowercase ones. So \`"Z" < "a"\` is \`True\` — weird but true. Mix cases carefully when sorting.

> 💡 The exact numbers (\`A\` = 65, etc.) come later in **lesson 9**. For now, just remember: "uppercase < lowercase."

### Why?

\`+\` means different things for different types:
- string + string → join end to end
- number + number → add

But **string + number**? Python doesn't guess. Some languages would auto-convert; Python refuses on purpose — being strict prevents bugs later.

\`\`\`text

\`print()\` even adds a space between items for you.

- **Mix labels and numbers** — \`print("count:", n, "items")\`
- **Print True/False results** — \`print("found:", "love" in text)\`

          content: `What if you want a **newline** inside a string? Or a **quote** inside a string that's already wrapped in quotes? You need a trick.

### The problem — quote conflict

\`\`\`python
text = "He said "hi""    # ❌ SyntaxError
\`\`\`

Python sees the second \`"\` as the end of the string, then gets confused by \`hi""\` after it. We need a way to say "this quote is **part of the string**, not the end."

### The solution — backslash \\

> 💡 The backslash key (\`\\\\\`) sits **above the Enter key** on most keyboards (on Korean layouts it's the \`₩\` key — same key!). It often gets confused with the regular slash \`/\`.

A backslash tells Python "**treat the next character specially**":

\`\`\`python
text = "He said \\"hi\\""
print(text)
\`\`\`

The \`\\"\` is "an actual quote character, not the end of the string."`

|---|---|---|
| \`\\n\` | newline | \`"a\\nb"\` → \`a\` then \`b\` on next line |
| \`\\t\` | tab | \`"a\\tb"\` → \`a    b\` |
| \`\\"\` | double quote | inside \`"..."\` |
| \`\\'\` | single quote | inside \`'...'\` |
| \`\\\\\` | backslash itself | \`"C:\\\\folder"\` → \`C:\\folder\` |

### Common uses

- **Multi-line output** — one \`print\` with \`\\n\` between sections
- **Tab-aligned columns** — \`"name\\tscore"\`
- **Quoted text inside strings** — \`"\\"hello\\""\`
- **Windows file paths** — \`"C:\\\\Users\\\\..."\`

> 💡 Memorize **\`\\n\`** and **\`\\t\`** — those are the ones you'll really use.`

If your text contains \`"\`, wrap it in \`'\` (and vice versa). No backslash needed!

\`\`\`python
print("It's fine")         # outer "..." → inner ' is fine
print('She said "hello"')  # outer '...' → inner " is fine
\`\`\`

### Multi-line — triple quotes

For long multi-line text, \`"""..."""\` keeps newlines as you type them:

\`\`\`python
text = """First line
Second line
Third line"""
print(text)
\`\`\`

### ❌ Don't get confused

\`\`\`python
print("a\\nb")    # two lines
print("a\\\\nb")   # literal: a\\nb (showing the backslash itself)
\`\`\`

You need two \`\\\\\` to print one backslash.`

✅ **+** for joining strings
✅ **\\*** for string repetition (separators)
✅ **len()** for string length
✅ **Indexing \`s[0]\`, \`s[-1]\`** — single character
✅ **in / not in** — substring check
✅ **==, <, >** — equality / dictionary order
✅ **print() comma** — print labels with numbers without errors
✅ **Escapes** — \`\\n\` newline, \`\\t\` tab, \`\\"\` quote
✅ **Triple quotes** — multi-line at once

Next time, we'll learn about **string methods** — case change, whitespace stripping, search/replace, and more! 🚀`
