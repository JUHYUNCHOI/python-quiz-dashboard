A digit can't lead. Python would be confused: "is this a variable or a number?"

- Python special words like \`if\` → ❌

### UPPER / lower case (in detail)

\`\`\`python

Connect words with \`_\`. **Python recommends this one!**
(Official name: snake_case — the letters stretched out by \`_\` look like a snake.)

### 🐪 Camel style — \`playerHp\`

Capitalize the first letter of later words. **Common in other languages like JavaScript.**

\`\`\`python
player_hp = 100   # ✅ underscore — Python style

For now, commas are enough. **Gluing text and variable with no space** comes:

- **lesson 5** — string \`+\` concatenation
- **lesson 8** — f-string (the cleanest!)

Coming soon — hang tight 🙂

Anything after the \`#\` symbol on a line is skipped.

# This whole line is a comment — Python skips it
print('Hello!')  # End-of-line comments work too (only after the #)

# Often used to label variables
hp = 100       # starting health
score = 0      # starting score

1. **Future-you** — "What does this do?" Comments answer it instantly
2. **Sharing with friends** — easier for others to read
3. **Temporarily disabling code (debugging)** — add \`#\` in front and it stops running

\`\`\`python
print('A')
# print('B')   ← skipped, won't run
print('C')
\`\`\`

Output: \`A\` and \`C\` (B is commented out)

### ⚠️ Watch out

\`\`\`python
print('#hello')   # → #hello (# inside quotes is NOT a comment!)
\`\`\`

A \`#\` inside quotes is **just a character**. Only \`#\` outside string quotes acts as a comment.`

✅ **Variable** = a **labeled box** that holds data
✅ Store with \`variable = value\` (\`=\` means "put into")
✅ Retrieve by using the variable name (no quotes!)
✅ **Putting a new value in** (reassignment) — assigning a new value overwrites the old (\`x = x + 3\` works)
✅ **Naming rules** — letters/digits/_, first char letter or _, no Python special words, underscore style (snake_case), meaningful names
✅ **Comments (\`#\`)** — notes Python ignores, also handy for debugging
✅ Print variables chained with \`,\` (auto space)

Next up: **operators** (\`+ - * / %\` etc.) for calculation and comparison! 🚀
(Gluing text and variable without space comes in lessons 5 and 8.)`
